 * SCC Dependency Graph
 *
 * SCCGraph is used to express the dependence relation between SCC, or Strongly
 * Connect Componnets in {@link ValGraph}. In other words, SCCGraph is the
 * "condensation" of {@link ValGraph}. It's constructed by contracting SCCs of
 * {@link ValVertex} into {@link SCCVertex}s. The resulting graph is guranteed
 * to be a DAG, or Directed Acyclic Graph, which has the property to be
 * topologically sorted, or scheduled, that we leveraged to perform a change
 * propagation process that we called "Dependency Reduction".
 *
 * Although customized, it is insipred by TDG (Task Dependency Graph) that are
 * often used in build systems (e.g. Build Systems Ã  la Carte).
