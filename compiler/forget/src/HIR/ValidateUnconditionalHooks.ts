/**
 * Validates that the function honors the [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning)
 * rule that hooks may not be called conditionally. More precisely, a component or hook must always call the
 * same set of hooks in the same order.
 *
 * The algorithm is based on [Dominators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominator_(graph_theory)). Hooks may
 * only be called in basic blocks that are unconditionally reachable from the entry node. In graph theory,
 * this corresponds to basic blocks which post dominate the entry block â€” that are on every path from the
 * entry block to the exit:
 *
 * ```
 *                 bb0 (entry)
 *                /         \
 *             bb1          bb2
 *               \         /
 *                   bb3
 *                    |
 *                 (exit)
 * ```
 *
 * Here, neither bb1 or bb2 post dominate the entry, which corresponds to the fact that control can
 * flow from the entry node to either of these nodes. However, bb3 does post dominate the entry node:
 * control flow will _always_ reach bb3 from the entry node. In this graph is is therefore safe to call
 * hooks only in bb0 and bb3, the post dominators of bb0.
 *
 * However if for example bb2 were to early return:
 *
 * ```
 *                 bb0 (entry)
 *                /         \
 *             bb1          bb2
 *               \           |
 *                   bb3    /
 *                    |   /
 *                 (exit)
 * ```
 *
 * Now only the exit node would post dominate the entry node: there is no other node which is
 * guaranteed to be reachable.  In this graph is is only safe to call hooks in bb0.
