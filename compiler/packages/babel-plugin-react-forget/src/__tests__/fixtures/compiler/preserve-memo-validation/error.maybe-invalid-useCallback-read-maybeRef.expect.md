## Input

```javascript
// @validatePreserveExistingMemoizationGuarantees
import { useCallback } from "react";

function useHook(maybeRef) {
  return useCallback(() => {
    return [maybeRef.current];
  }, [maybeRef]);
}

```


## Error

```
Todo: Could not preserve manual memoization because an inferred dependency does not match the dependency list in source. The inferred dependency was `maybeRef.current`, but the source dependencies were [maybeRef]. Detail: differences in ref.current access
