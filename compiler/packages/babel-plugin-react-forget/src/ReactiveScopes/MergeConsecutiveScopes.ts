/**
 * The primary goal of this pass is to reduce memoization overhead, specifically:
 * - Use fewer memo slots
 * - Reduce the number of comparisons and other memoization-related instructions
 *
 * This is achieved by merging consecutive reactive scopes when the two scopes
 * will always invalidate together. The idea is that if two scopes would always
 * invalidate together, it's more efficient to group the scopes together to save
 * on memoization overhead.
 *
 * This optimization is necessarily somewhat limited. First, we only merge
 * scopes that are in the same (reactive) block, ie we don't merge across
 * control-flow or block-scoping boundaries. Second, we can only merge scopes
 * so long as any intermediate instructions are safe to memoize â€” specifically,
 * as long as the values created by those instructions are only referenced by
 * the second scope and not elsewhere. This is to avoid changing control-flow
 * and to avoid increasing the number of scope outputs (which defeats the optimization).
 *
 * With that in mind we can apply the optimization in two cases. Given a block with
 * scope A, some safe-to-memoize instructions I, and scope B, we can merge scopes when:
 * - A and B have identical dependencies. This means they will invalidate together, so
 *   by merging the scopes we can avoid duplicate cache slots and duplicate checks of
 *   those dependencies.
 * - The output of A is the input to B. Any invalidation of A will change its output
 *   which invalidates B, so we can similarly merge scopes. Note that this optimization
 *   may not be beneficial if the outupts of A are not guaranteed to change if its input
 *   changes, but in practice this is generally the case.
